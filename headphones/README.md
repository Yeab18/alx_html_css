# Responsive Web Design Project

This project is a responsive web page based on a [Figma design](#) that adapts gracefully to different screen sizes and interactions. It implements mobile responsiveness, hover states, and structured content styling.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a responsive web design using HTML, CSS (or your preferred framework), and JavaScript (if applicable). The design was duplicated from a Figma file and strictly follows the original layout, styles, and interactions.

## üé® Figma Design

Before you begin, make sure to have a Figma account and access to the original design file:

1. **Create a Figma account**: https://figma.com
2. **Open the design project** (provided by your team or client).
3. Click **"Duplicate to your Drafts"** to access all design details and layers.

> **Note**: If the direct link is not working, a backup Figma file is available in the project folder.

### Fonts Used

- **Source Sans Pro**: [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
- **Spin Cycle OT**: [Download here](https://www.fonts.com/font/house-industries/spin-cycle)

Make sure these fonts are installed locally or loaded via web fonts in your project.

## üìê Design Notes

- Some measurements in the Figma file may be in **float values** (e.g., `26.4px`). You can round these to the nearest integer where precision is not critical.
- **Max content width**: `1000px`, centered on the page.
- All layouts must maintain spacing, typography, and alignments consistent with the design.
